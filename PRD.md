## Design Direction
The design should evoke industrial strength combined with modern sophistication—serious and professional yet approachable, with clean lines reminiscent of precision engineering. A minimal interface serves the content best, avoiding decorative clutter while using strategic whitespace and subtle motion to guide attention and convey quality.

## Color Selection
Triadic color scheme balancing industrial steel blues, earthy reliability, and energetic accents to communicate both traditional manufacturing heritage and forward-thinking innovation.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Industrial Blue (oklch(0.38 0.12 250)) - Communicates trust, professionalism, and technical expertise as the foundational brand color with enhanced saturation for better visual impact
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Warm Steel Gray (oklch(0.48 0.02 260)) - Supporting neutral that adds sophistication without coldness
  - Terracotta Accent (oklch(0.58 0.15 35)) - Warmth representing fire, forge, and human elements of manufacturing
- **Accent Color**: Vibrant Orange (oklch(0.70 0.20 45)) - High-energy highlight for CTAs and important interactive elements, suggesting innovation and energy
- **Background Enhancement**: Subtle color tints applied to background (oklch(0.985 0.002 260)) for warmth and depth, moving away from pure white
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (Soft Warm White oklch(0.985 0.002 260)): Deep charcoal text (oklch(0.25 0.015 260)) - Ratio 12.2:1 ✓
  - Card (Very Light Warm oklch(0.99 0.001 260)): Deep charcoal text (oklch(0.25 0.015 260)) - Ratio 11.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Typography should convey engineering precision and corporate professionalism with excellent readability across long-form content, using a contemporary sans-serif family that balances geometric clarity with humanist warmth.

**Primary Font**: Inter - Modern, highly legible sans-serif with excellent screen optimization and professional character suitable for both headlines and body content

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Hero Title): Inter Bold/48px/tight letter-spacing (-0.02em)/line-height 1.1
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/36px/tight letter-spacing (-0.01em)/line-height 1.2
  - H3 (Subsection Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal letter-spacing/line-height 1.3
  - H4 (Card Titles): Inter Medium/20px/normal letter-spacing/line-height 1.4
  - Body (Content): Inter Regular/16px/normal letter-spacing/line-height 1.6
  - Small (Captions): Inter Regular/14px/normal letter-spacing/line-height 1.5
  - Button Text: Inter Medium/16px/slight letter-spacing (0.01em)

## Animations
Animations should be purposeful and restrained, reflecting industrial precision—subtle entrance animations that reveal content systematically, smooth scrolling that feels engineered rather than rushed, and micro-interactions that provide tactile feedback without frivolity. **Enhanced with comprehensive GSAP animations throughout all sections for professional polish.**

**Animation Library**: GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) with ScrollTrigger plugin for professional, performance-optimized animations with precise control and smooth easing.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion communicates quality and attention to detail through smooth, physics-based transitions that feel engineered and intentional, never arbitrary or playful
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: 
  - Primary: Hero elements fade-up with stagger on load using GSAP timeline, section headers slide in as they enter viewport with ScrollTrigger
  - Secondary: Product cards stagger-animate with GSAP delays (0.1s increments), smooth entrance animations triggered by scroll position
  - Tertiary: Hover states on buttons (lift/shadow increase), ScrollTrigger-based animations for sections, automated carousels for testimonials and certifications
- **Implementation Details**: 
  - Hero Section: Multi-layered entrance with badge sliding from left (0.6s), content fading up (0.8s), stats appearing (0.8s delay), features scaling with back easing
  - All Sections: Title animations triggered at 80% viewport entry with fade-up and y-translation
  - Product/Service Cards: Individual card animations with staggered delays based on index (index * 0.1s) for cascading effect
  - Gallery Items: Stagger animation with 0.05s delays for smooth sequential appearance
  - Testimonials: Auto-rotating carousel (7s interval) with smooth transitions between slides
  - Certifications: Auto-rotating showcase (5s interval) with scale and fade animations
  - Contact Form: Split animation - form slides from left, contact cards stagger from right
  - Quality Cards: Staggered grid animation (0.1s) for cohesive group entrance
  - CTA Sections: Scale animations with back.out easing for attention-grabbing polish
  - GSAP `gsap.from()` for entrance animations with power2/power3 easing
  - ScrollTrigger for viewport-based animations with `start: 'top 80%'` triggers
  - Context cleanup with `gsap.context()` for proper React component lifecycle management
  - Stagger effects for grid items to create cascading entrance animations (0.05s - 0.15s delays)
  - Hover transforms on cards: -translate-y-1 with shadow transitions
